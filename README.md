# Unit Conversion Utility

Handy utility to quickly convert between inches and millimeters. For reading woodworking plans and working with the CNC, I regularly need to jump between in <-> mm and it became really annoying. This tool fixes the frustrations I had with the Windows conversion calculator and is easier than using Google. Jump quickly between inputs with Tab, every focus change highlights the whole input for quick replacement when time for a new conversion. No cruft, no ads, just fast math.

Created in Python using Tk/Tkinter for the GUI
